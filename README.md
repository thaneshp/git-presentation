# Dev(){CoP} Fundamentals of Git Presentation

These are the slides I used for a lightning talk presentation I gave at the Dev(){CoP} meetup on 28/10/2020. The idea behind the talk was to give listeners a fundamental understanding of Git by explaining key concepts and demonstrating this by using the command line interface (CLI).
